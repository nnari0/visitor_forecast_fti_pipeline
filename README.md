# Visitor Forecast FTI Pipeline – MLOps Project

Forecasting the number of visitors at a fitness and wellness park in Lucerne for the next 1–3 hours. Implemented as an FTI architecture (Feature /
Training / Inference Pipeline) using the Hopsworks Feature Store as the
central feature repository and MLflow as the model registry.

---

## 1. Use Case and Data

### What is being predicted?
The number of visitors (`visitors`) inside the location during an
upcoming hour — i.e. a regression problem.

### Data Source 1 – Visitor counts (historical)
A CSV file (`data/crawled_content.csv`) containing ~28,000 observations
spanning ~26 months (February 2024 – April 2026). Each row holds a
timestamp and the number of visitors present at that moment. The data was
originally crawled from a publicly visible occupancy display of the park
and is sampled at irregular intervals (~5–15 min). For this project the
samples are aggregated to hourly means.

### Data Source 2 – Weather ([Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/))
Hourly weather data for Lucerne (47.05° N, 8.31° E):
- **Historical** via `archive-api.open-meteo.com` (used for training)
- **Forecast** via `api.open-meteo.com` (used for inference)

Open-Meteo does not require an API key.

## 2. Features

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visitors_avg_24h` | **aggregated** (rolling 24 h) | Mean visitor count over the last 24 hours |
| `visitors_avg_7d` | **aggregated** (rolling 7 days) | Mean over the last week — captures weekly seasonality |
| `hour` | calendar | Hour of day (0–23) |
| `day_of_week` | calendar | Day of week (0=Mon … 6=Sun) |
| `month` | calendar | Month (1–12) |
| `is_weekend` | calendar | 1 for Sat/Sun, 0 otherwise |
| `temperature_2m` | **RT** (weather) | Current temperature 2 m above ground |
| `precipitation` | **RT** (weather) | Current precipitation amount |
| `cloud_cover` | **RT** (weather) | Current cloud cover |
| `relative_humidity_2m` | **RT** (weather) | Current relative humidity |

this includes following feature types :
- **aggregated feature spanning multiple timesteps**:
  `visitors_avg_24h` and `visitors_avg_7d` are computed via
  `pandas.Series.rolling(...).mean()` over previous hourly values. A
  preceding `shift(1)` ensures that the label cannot leak into its own
  features.
- **real-time feature**: the weather variables are only
  available at inference time and are pulled live from Open-Meteo's
  forecast endpoint.

**Label**: `visitors` — hourly mean of the observed visitor count.

## 3. Model

`sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` configured with:

- `n_estimators = 200`
- `max_depth = 12`
- `min_samples_leaf = 5`
- `random_state = 42`

Deliberately kept small — the goal of the assignment is a clean FTI
pipeline, not predictive accuracy. Train and test sets are split
**chronologically** (train: everything before 2026-01-01, test: from
2026-01-01 onwards), because a random split on time-series data would
introduce leakage.

### Feature Pipeline (`pipelines/feature_pipeline.py`)
1. Read CSV, parse timestamps, filter implausible values
2. Aggregate to hourly means
3. Fetch historical weather from the Open-Meteo Archive API
4. Join both sources on `event_time`
5. Feature engineering: rolling windows + calendar features
6. Insert into the Hopsworks feature group `wellnesspark_features` (v1)

### Training Pipeline (`pipelines/training_pipeline.py`)
1. Pull the feature group from Hopsworks
2. Create / load the feature view `wellnesspark_view` (v1)
3. Read training data from the feature view
4. Chronological train/test split
5. Train RandomForest, compute metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
6. Log model to MLflow + persist locally as joblib

### Inference Pipeline (`pipelines/inference_pipeline.py`)
1. Load model from the MLflow registry (fallback: local joblib)
2. Read the latest aggregated features from the feature store
3. Pull a live weather forecast for the next hours via Open-Meteo
4. Build feature vectors, run prediction, print results

## 6. Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python ≥ 3.12 and < 3.14 (Hopsworks requirement)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment and dependency management
- An account on [hopsworks.ai](https://www.hopsworks.ai/) (free tier is enough)

### Installation
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd visitor_forecast_fti_pipeline

# Create the virtual environment and install locked dependencies
uv sync
```

`uv sync` reads [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) and [uv.lock](uv.lock), creates a `.venv/` in the project root, and installs the exact pinned versions. Prefix subsequent commands with `uv run` (e.g. `uv run python -m pipelines.feature_pipeline`) or activate the venv manually with `source .venv/bin/activate`.

### Hopsworks API key
1. Sign in on [app.hopsworks.ai](https://app.hopsworks.ai)
2. Account Settings → API Keys → create a new key with the scopes
   `featurestore`, `project`, `job`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste in your key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set HOPSWORKS_API_KEY
```

### Run the pipelines (in this order)

```bash
# 1) Feature Pipeline – ingest historical data into the feature store
uv run -m pipelines.feature_pipeline

# 2) Training Pipeline – train the model and register it in MLflow
uv run -m pipelines.training_pipeline

# 3) Inference Pipeline – forecast the next few hours
uv run -m pipelines.inference_pipeline
```

### View MLflow runs (optional)
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ./mlruns
# Browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 7. Reflection and Limitations

The solution is intentionally minimal and has a few known shortcomings:

1. **Aggregated features are not recomputed live at inference time.**
   The inference pipeline reads the most recent value of
   `visitors_avg_24h` / `visitors_avg_7d` from the feature group and uses
   it as a stand-in for "now". A production pipeline would either
   re-aggregate the last 7 days of raw visitor data on demand or use an
   online feature group with continuously updated aggregates. For this
   assignment, this simplification is explicitly permitted.

2. **No real live visitor data**: the CSV is a historical crawl; the
   pipeline simulates "current" aggregates via the latest stored data
   point. A production version would need to integrate the crawler into
   the feature pipeline and trigger it hourly (e.g. via GitHub Actions).

3. **Weather gaps are filled with `ffill`/`bfill`.** This is robust for
   isolated missing hours but not ideal for longer outages. A production
   system would benefit from data validation using Great Expectations
   (which is integrated into Hopsworks — see "extension stages" in the
   assignment).

4. **No hyperparameter tuning.** The RandomForest uses pragmatically
   chosen values; neither cross-validation nor grid search are
   implemented. This is consistent with the assignment ("performance is
   not a grading criterion").

5. **Gaps in the source CSV**: the original CSV contains visible periods
   where no observations exist for hours or days. Those hours simply do
   not appear in the final training set — they don't distort the
   aggregates because the rolling windows use a `min_periods` parameter.

6. **The chronological test set covers only ~3.5 months (Jan–Apr 2026).**
   Seasonal effects (e.g. summer operations) are therefore not represented
   in the test split.

7. **No containerization, no online serving.** Extension stages such as
   Docker, Hopsworks model deployment, or a web service were intentionally
   left out.
